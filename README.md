Hi everybody, although I,ve been working in developing embedded systems for several years, right now, I'm focused
in working and developing machine learning applications. Because of that I started to study, different items related to ML at Platzi, and 
then I was invited to Platzi-Master program where I'm raising  my skills at a superior level.
