Hi everybody, although I,ve been working in developing embedded systems for several years, right now, I'm focused
in working and developing machine learning applications. Because of that I started to study, different items related to ML at Platzi, and 
then I was invited to Platzi-Master program where I'm raising  my skills at a superior level.

One of the most amazing and challenging projects I participated, was the development of a vending  machine. Such a machine sells copies and impressions. The graphical interface was built in c# because we needed to interact with microsoft software. The brain of the machine is an embedded  sytem, which was programmed en c++.
